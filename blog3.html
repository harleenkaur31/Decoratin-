	<h3>KITCHEN CLEAN OUT</h3> 
	<img class="kitchen1 center" src="images/blog1img1.jpg ">
	<p>
		A clean and clutter free kitchen is everybody’s dream. However, things have a way of stacking up inside cabinets, taking away storage space and leaving your cupboards looking crowded and disorganised.

By simply reclaiming your space and bringing order to the busiest, most important room in the home with a quick reorganisation and clear out, you can easily refresh your home without too much hassle.
	</p>
    <img class="kitchen2 center"src="images/blog1img2.jpg">
    <p>
    If you have open shelving, try rearranging them just to have the essentials on show, bringing a clean and aesthetic look to your space. Additionally, try spicing up your kitchen a little more by adding some quality kitchen accessories to complement your kitchen counters.

<h3>MAKE IT YOUR OWN AND TELL YOUR STORY</h3>
<img class="kitchen1 center"src="images/blog2img1.jpg">
<p>A good interior is one that tells a story through its owners. This is your own home so add your personality and style. You are in control of your own home, so make it something special.
<br>
Your home is where you spend most of your time, so the space needs to reflect you.



</p>
<br>
<h3>MAKE YOUR BEDROOM A SPECIAL SPACE</h3>
<img class="kitchen1 center"src="images/blog3img2.jpg">
<p>
	When you welcome guests into your home, they should instantly know that this is your space. Having a unique item or piece of furniture in your living space adds style whilst showcasing your personality.

Try adding a unique piece of furniture such as a stylish, comfortable lounge chair. Lounge chairs are no longer seen as just seating, but can create comfort and a luxurious touch to your space.
<br>
Discover the best ways to declutter your space.

Additionally, sleep is one of the most important ways to stay happy and healthy so use bedding that will give you comfort and the sleep you deserve.

Linen has always been a popular bedding to use and is widely considered to be a luxurious fabric to have in your home.

The huge appeal of using linen as bed sheets is that it is both practical and aesthetically pleasing.

Linen fabric is the perfect companion for a good night’s sleep and is renowned for its breathability, keeping you warm during the winter and cooler during the summer.

You won’t want to sleep on anything else. Explore our linen bedding, from throws to blankets and pillows.
<br>
We offer a large selection of different lounge chairs that you can choose from according to your taste and style. From boho lounge chairs to an elegant Scandinavian style, we have unique lounge chairs for your home.
</p>
<br>
<h3>WARM LIGHTING</h3>
<img class="kitchen1 center"src="images/blog2img3.jpg">
<p>
	Light is more than just a way to illuminate a room. Adding the right kind of lighting to your home can make a significant difference in your health, mood and the atmosphere around you.

If you want to create a specific mood in your home, lighting is always the way to do it. You can make a room cozy and warm or fresh and minimalistic. Every type of lighting that you integrate into your home should add a dash of your personality.
<br>
Table lamps are one way of creating a laid back atmosphere in your home. They can be functional and stylish. Many of our table lamps have a simple and stylish design and are a perfect way to add a classic accent to your home decor.

Table lamps are perfect to place in the living room with your sofa, adding soft light to your reading nook or creating coziness to your bedroom.
</p>

<h3>ADD A RUG</h3>
<img class="kitchen1 center"src="images/blog2img4.jpg">
<p>
	Adding a rug changes the focal point of any room and certainly adds a visual beauty that every home deserves. It instantly creates a space more cozy, comfortable and can pull together various colours used in the decor.

They are versatile and all rugs can be incorporated into a variety of different design styles.

<p>
    As summer has arrived, a jute rug would be the perfect accent piece in your home. Jute rugs are created with natural fibers, providing a stylish, raw texture to your home. In addition to this, jute is a fibre that is environmentally friendly which also provides your home with a calming atmosphere.
</p>
</p>

<h3>MAKE YOUR home SUIT THE SEASON</h3>
<img class="kitchen1 center"src="images/blog3img3.jpg">
<p>
	We have a never ending opportunity by changing up our spaces according to the seasons. Now that the warmer season is arriving, it is important to have a home that feels breezy and allows the sun to shine through.

<p>
    So our designers recommend brightening up your space with a neutral palette and natural decor.
<br>
Using colours, like whites, beige and different shades of light greys automatically allows you to have a brighter space which can then be decorated by adding layers of texture and colours.
