	<h3>KITCHEN CLEAN OUT</h3>
	<img class="kitchen1 center" src="images/blog1img1.jpg ">
	<p>
		A clean and clutter free kitchen is everybody’s dream. However, things have a way of stacking up inside cabinets, taking away storage space and leaving your cupboards looking crowded and disorganised.

By simply reclaiming your space and bringing order to the busiest, most important room in the home with a quick reorganisation and clear out, you can easily refresh your home without too much hassle.
	</p>
    <img class="kitchen2 center"src="images/blog1img2.jpg">
    <p>
    If you have open shelving, try rearranging them just to have the essentials on show, bringing a clean and aesthetic look to your space. Additionally, try spicing up your kitchen a little more by adding some quality kitchen accessories to complement your kitchen counters.
</p> -->
<br>
<h3>COMFORT IS KEY</h3>
<img class="kitchen1 center"src="images/blog2img1.jpg">
<p>As we have realised the importance of comfort in our homes, incorporating quality furniture into your designs can help you create a more relaxing atmosphere. That is why choosing a linen sofa is the first step into creating a calming atmosphere.

    Linen feels cool and smooth, making it a popular upholstery choice for any climate. Additionally, linen is also appreciated for its durability. If you’re looking for an upholstery fabric that lasts for years, it doesn’t get much much better than linen.
    Our linen sofas will offer your space style as well as a laid back atmosphere and will be the place you want to sit back and relax in after a long day. All our linen sofas are hand crafted with perfection and built with quality in mind.

    The sofas offer a wooden frame, providing resilience. The linen upholstery is removable, meaning it can be washed or replaced whenever you want, perfect for a family.

<p>
	Light is more than just a way to illuminate a room. Adding the right kind of lighting to your home can make a significant difference in your health, mood and the atmosphere around you.

If you want to create a specific mood in your home, lighting is always the way to do it. You can make a room cozy and warm or fresh and minimalistic. Every type of lighting that you integrate into your home should add a dash of your personality.
<br>
Table lamps are one way of creating a laid back atmosphere in your home. They can be functional and stylish. Many of our table lamps have a simple and stylish design and are a perfect way to add a classic accent to your home decor.

Table lamps are perfect to place in the living room with your sofa, adding soft light to your reading nook or creating coziness to your bedroom.

<h3>ADD A RUG</h3>
<img class="kitchen1 center"src="images/blog2img4.jpg">
<p>
	Adding a rug changes the focal point of any room and certainly adds a visual beauty that every home deserves. It instantly creates a space more cozy, comfortable and can pull together various colours used in the decor.

They are versatile and all rugs can be incorporated into a variety of different design styles.
